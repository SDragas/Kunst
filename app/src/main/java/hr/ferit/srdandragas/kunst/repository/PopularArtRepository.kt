His innumerable \\u201chemp-fiber\\u201d texture strokes create a unifying rhythm among the towering mountains with tightly knit masses of rocks.

At age 16, after failing the entrance exam for the naval academy, he embarked as an apprentice on a training ship, traveling as far away as Rio de Janeiro. The sea would always capture his imagination, and in 1864 he painted several seascapes. This painting was made nearly ten years later, while the artist was staying in Berck-sur-Mer, near Boulogne. Exploring light and movement, he rapidly sketched the sails of the countless ships that dance in the wind on blue-green waves highlighted with white. Manet even added a slight curve to the horizon, thus conveying an impression of infinite space, despite the painting's small size.", images = Images

In addition to being preparatory for paintings, they were used by studio assistants to aid the master and were copied by pupils. Extremely cautious, Rubens guarded his drawings like studio secrets from competitors who could exploit them for their own compositions. Striking in its immediacy, this drawing is a preparatory study for a painting now at the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh. Herod, wearing a large cap and wrapped in a mantle, shrinks back horror-struck as Salome uncovers a charger that holds the head of Saint John the Baptist. In the most chilling detail, Herodias, seated at the far side of the table, gestures toward the charger with a fork in her right hand.", images = Images
